Greetings, my name is Denis. At the moment I can't boast that I am a frontend developer, but I am striving for it by taking a course on frontend development from rolling scopes school.

As for education, I study in trade and economic College in my city for a specialty unrelated to programming

My main motivation to study programming is the desire not only to live a decent life, to be able to provide for myself and my family, which, of course, everyone wants (and that's normal), but also to do things that benefit society and to do what is really interesting to me. After all, work that does not resonate in the heart is doomed to become a boring routine.

I don't have any ultimate goal: the IT sphere is developing rapidly and programmers are required to constantly develop and improve their professional skills. And this is good: without constant self-development, the ability to think critically deteriorates. But there may not be a final goal, but there is an intermediate one: to become a junior frontend developer, having received my first offer.

Of course, I should mention the past stages of my training at Rolling scopes. Among the most interesting for me I can single out two assignments, in which I had to develop a game. The first assignment was at stage 0 with the freedom to choose a game and my eye fell on the long familiar 2048. It became my first game that I wrote. It should be noted that before I started writing the code for this game I doubted my abilities a lot and didn't even think that in the end I would not only successfully implement all the game functionality and get the maximum score, but I would do it without peeking at implementation ideas on the Internet. Perhaps because of that my code doesn't look the best, but I can confidently say that I wrote it myself, and besides, it was only the very beginning of the learning process.

The second game was nonograms, which I approached more confidently, although I had some concerns. I made it without any problems.

The layout of sites and realization of their functionality also gave me pleasure from the process, but it was writing the logic of games that made me think harder, build complex logical chains in my head to then reflect them in the code.

That's it
