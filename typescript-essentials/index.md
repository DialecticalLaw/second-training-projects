## Reflections

1. *In the first module, I learned about the advantages of TypeScript over JavaScript, and also learned how to compile files with the TS extension into JS code. This laid the foundation for further understanding of TypeScript.*
2. *In the second module, I learned about union and intersection types. I also learned how to declare variables using primitive and object types, which helped me understand the main differences between TypeScript and JavaScript code.*
3. *In the third module, I learned about interfaces and how to create and extend them using TypeScript. This knowledge will help me write more readable, maintainable, and reliable code in future projects.*
4. *In the fourth module, I learned about the advantages of using types in functions, as well as various nuances regarding function parameters (such as rest, default parameters, and optional and mandatory parameters). Knowledge of these things will help you write more readable and reliable code, which will reduce the likelihood of mistakes related to passing incorrect parameters to a function.*
5. *In the fifth module, I learned about some of the features of TypeScript classes. I learned about access modifiers and the interaction between classes and interfaces. I also learned when it's better to use a class rather than an interface and vice versa. This knowledge will help me write more correct and readable code in the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm.*
6. *In the sixth module, I learned about generics and how different language structures interact with them. In particular, I have mastered generic-functions, generic-classes and generic-interfaces. This will help me to write code in a way that respects the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.*
7. *In the seventh module, I learned about exporting and importing modules in TypeScript. This knowledge will help me organize project files more meaningfully and understandably in the future.*
8. *In the last module, I learned about namespaces and how to use them. I also learned when to use a namespace or module. This knowledge will help me to avoid confusion when organizing the structure of my future projects and using the right tool for each task.*
